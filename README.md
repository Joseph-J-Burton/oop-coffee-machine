# soda-mix-machine
## OOP project
This is a project I work on for a Python Learning course.
This project started out as a Cofee Machine, but since I'm not into coffee and don't know much about it.
I decided to change it into a soda machine.

The future improvements would be:
Adjust the machine to allow you to pick your base, flavor, and additional shots (e.g. vanilla, lemon, lime, etc.).
It could allow you to pick a slushy or a shake instead of a soda.
It would also be nice to be able to pick the size of cup.
