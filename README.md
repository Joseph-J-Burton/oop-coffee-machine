# soda-mix-machine
## OOP project
This is a project from a Python Learning course I'm working through to refresh my python coding skills.
# *list skills used in the project*
# *list the steps and how it works*


The future improvements would be:
I'm not into Coffe, so I don't know much about it. I would like to convert this into a soda machine.
Adjust the machine to allow you to pick your base, flavor, and additional shots (e.g. vanilla, lemon, lime, etc.).
It could allow you to pick a slushy or a shake instead of a soda.
It would also be nice to be able to pick the size of cup.
