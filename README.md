# Coin-op Coffee Machine
## Object Oriented Programming Project
This is a project from a Python Learning course. I'm working through the course to refresh my python coding skills.
## Skills  
[] while loops  
[] classes  
[] functions  
[] user input  
[] if statements


## What does the program do?  
The program provides a list of options and asks the user what they would like.  
The user inputs a name from the list.  
Resources are checked.  
Then the user is asked to insert coins.  
How many quaters, then dimes, nickles, and pennies.  
The coin input is acessed against the cost of the drink.  
Change is provided or if not enough, returned back to begining.  
If the money provided is enough, the drink is made and a message is given to the user.  
Off is used to exit the program.  
Report will print out the resource level and total money collected.  


## Future Improvement    
Fix error that happens when the user doesn't enter a valid response.  
I'm not into coffee, so I don't know much about it. I would like to convert this into a soda machine.  
Adjust the machine to allow you to pick your base, flavor, and additional shots (e.g. vanilla, lemon, lime, etc.).  
It could allow you to pick a slushy or a shake instead of a soda.  
It would be nice to be able to pick the size of cup.
